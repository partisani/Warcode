* Warcode
A basic programming language, for the GameTank console,
that compiles to 6502 assembly. It has a very simple and
/beginner friendly/ syntax that makes it easy to use, but
hard to master.

** Objectives:
+ Having a simple syntax.
+ Being small, but usable.
+ Being fast to parse and compile.
+ Allowing code to run on different systems, like the GameTank, or the NES.

** Getting Started:
*** Installation:
/WIP/

*** Getting Started:
Warcode, being a small language, hasn't too many features,
for now it includes only variables, functions, structs,
constants, and, last but not least, we have the ~#asm~ directive,
that tells just tells the compiler to include it in the final assembly.
